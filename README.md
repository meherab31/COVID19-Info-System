# COVID19-Info-System
This is a very static project I did by C language. Made for get information of people and will give information based suggestion. Only used function and other related syntax. No file or memory option that's why it cannot save iformation.. 

# Features:
1) On Immgrant Status if you input "Yes", it'll ask from which continent you came. After inputing the Name it'll highlight the continent with all continent and show some stats.
2) It will show some sympoms according to your answer it'll suggest which option you need- a.Self Quarantine or b. Rules and Regulations.
3) At the end It'll give you a chance to look back whatever you missed. 

# Note
As I've mentioned this is a static project you cannot change your command. If there is wrong then you have to start from the beginning again. 

I made it in very short knowledge of my C language. Please help me by showing my mistakes and by giving suggestions.
